#Lemons UnLimited
* This is a website that has the foundations built of a social media site. 
* It was written in Go and has a file system for a database. 
* Users can create a profile and are given their own page. 
* They can post on their page or a global discussion board. 
* They can add friends so they can access their pages quickly. 

The next step would be to integrate this site with a database like Mongo or MYSQL.

This was a project I worked on for a school, but I do have plans to expand it and make a much more robust site. The design is in need of a serious overhaul, but that wasn't the focus of the project at the beginning. I do like the logo and the name however. The goal is to make a social media site that can function as both a social and private communication site, as well as provide customizable pages. Essentially try to combine a CMS with a social media site.
